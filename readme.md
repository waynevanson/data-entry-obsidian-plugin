# Data Entry - Obsidian Plugin

## Packages

This repository contains multiple packages to ensure concerns are clearly separated.

- `packages/data-entry` contains the plugin that users install on their devices.
- `packages/obsidian-mocks` contains mocks used to replicate obsidian functionality, as the packages provided by the Obsidian team contains only types and not any implementation for tests.
